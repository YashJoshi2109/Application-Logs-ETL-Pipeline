# Application-Logs-ETL-Pipeline
You will build a pipeline that reads structured and semi‑structured log data, cleans and normalizes timestamps, computes metrics per service, and develops a simple model to predict whether a service is at risk of latency degradation. The final outputs include transformed datasets, metric files, and a predictive model with performance reports.
